# FiveThirtyEight Replication

[Link to Rpub](http://rpubs.com/cvendler/fivethirtyeight-replication)

Here, I replicate the graphic from FiveThirtyEight’s article, [Both Republicans and Democrats Have an Age Problem](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/both-republicans-and-democrats-have-an-age-problem/). The graph depicts the rolling two-term average age of new members of Congress which we can see experienced a brief dip in the late 70’s/80’s but has since risen and is now the highest it has been. Another interesting finding is that even though the graphic’s trend lines move similarly for both parties, Democrats have recently exhibited higher ages.
